Somthing I just hacked together as we needed it for some student projects
and we have a couple of PS3's lying around which don't do OpenGL under
Linux right now so before they just sit idle we let them trace some
rays ;-).

we will slowly improve it over time but if anybody wants to seriously  use it
let me know.

Currently it just does what I needed it to do, no fancy shading (not even
shadows yet).
